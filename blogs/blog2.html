        <h2>Why I aspire into becoming a web developer?</h2>
        <p>I will be penning down why I want to get into web dev.
            So let's start with what I did before BBA.
            I am an engineering drop-out.
            Honestly, we all know that you don't have to read theory or get a certain degree to get started with development.
            My journey has been similar. Although I hated engineering subjects I am thoroughly enjoying  the process of building the web lately.

            Yeah you'd wonder why am I realising this now?

            I recently stumbled upon Tanay's channel and got started with level 0 and I  also know that 
            the recent neog grads, many of whom are not even from an engineering background and landed their first tech job.
            This is pretty much why I am convinced that neogcamp could be a perfect platform where folks irrespective of 
            their background are welcome to get started with their full stack web development journey. 
            I could not help but get started with level 0 and wish to have a similar experience with web development.

            I've started understanding HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS and Git. I am still exloring these and enjoying the process.

            So I guess that's it for now. Stay tuned for more.
